Born in Pennsylvania, I now live in Colorado.
Which is great because I am somewhat of a skiing aficionado.
I have lived in Colorado for 20 years.
If I have to leave this state, I will be in tears!

I have degrees in Management and Engineering,
I enjoy being a geek, to me it is endearing!
But I am not all about zeroes and ones,
I have other interests that are indeed fun.

I like movies and museums with science and art,
History is a great subject of which I will not part.
I used to be a big beach goer,
But since living in Colorado, the mountains have taken over.

I like the Broncos Rockies and Avs,
Denver is a sports town, and their teams are not bad!
They also have the Nuggets and the Rapids too,
But I am not into soccer or basketball, that is true.

I like to travel and have been around the world,
Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Europe, these places are pearls.
But I have places that are on my bucket list,
Maybe in my retirement I will get to do this.
